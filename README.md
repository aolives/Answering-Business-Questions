[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/aolives/Answering-Business-Questions/HEAD)

In this project, we're going to practice using SQL skills to answer business questions.

Together we'll:

- Write a SQL query to extract the relevant data
- Write a short paragraph, drawing conclusions and explaining the data and/or visualizations.

More than anything else this project exists to show you that I am familiar with:

- SQL
- Jupyter Notebooks
